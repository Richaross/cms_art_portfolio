# 🎨 Art Portfolio & CMS

A high-performance, dark-themed art portfolio website featuring a custom Content Management System (CMS), integrated directly with Supabase and Cloudinary. This application serves as a comprehensive platform for artists to showcase their work, manage sales through limited drops, and publish news updates.

## ✨ Features & Architecture

### 1. Public Portfolio

- **Dynamic Landing Hero**: Fully customizable immersive introduction. Artists can manage title, background image, and dimming intensity via the CMS.
- **Social Integration**: High-visibility links to Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, and X.
- **Vertical Storytelling**: A redesigned portfolio experience that uses high-impact, full-width vertical scrolling for collections.
- **Interactive Shop Window**: Real-time commerce integration with a sleek popup "Shop Window" for for-sale items.
- **Archival Branding**: Premium "Archival" tags for pieces in private collections.
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time stock counts, pricing, and "For Sale" status toggles.

### 2. Custom CMS (Dashboard)

- **Service Layer Architecture**: Decoupled domain logic from Server Actions into dedicated services (`PortfolioService`, `NewsService`, `CloudinaryService`, `AboutService`, `HeroService`) for better testability and maintainability.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: A dedicated Hero Section editor to customize the landing page experience without touching code.
- **Strict Type Safety**: 100% type-safe codebase using generated Supabase types and domain-driven interfaces.
- **Automated Image Cleanup**: Built-in hooks to ensure that deleting a record permanently removes the asset from Cloudinary.
- **Integrated Monitoring**: Sentry integration for real-time error capture and UI error state logging.

### 3. Database Schema (Supabase)

The application uses a relational PostgreSQL schema (validated via `schema_v4_items.sql`):

- `sections`: Parent container for collections.
- `section_items`: Individual artworks linked to sections.
- `inventory`: Real-time commerce details.
- `news_posts`: Blog content and updates.
- `about_info`: Artist biography and portrait data.
- `hero_settings`: Singleton table for landing page customization.

### 4. Quality Assurance & CI/CD

- **Test-First Culture**: Strict adherence to TDD principles. Every feature is backed by failing unit tests before implementation.
- **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions running linting, type-checks, unit tests (Jest), and E2E smoke tests (Playwright) on every PR.
- **Git Hooks**: Husky and `lint-staged` enforce code quality and formatting (Prettier) before every commit.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=...
   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=...
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**
   Apply `schema_v4_items.sql` and `schema_v5_hero.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor.

### Development & Testing

- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev`
- **Unit Tests**: `npm run test`
- **E2E Tests**: `npm run test:e2e`
- **CI Simulation**: `npm run test:ci` (Lint + Test + E2E + Build)
